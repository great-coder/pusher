## About My Pusher

This app is base on laravel-websockets and trying to act like pusher server for pusher clients.  
As you may know, Pusher is a commercial service for serving sockets and realtime connections for apps, so we can use
this instead!

## How to run

Just type `php artisan webscokets:serve`  
It will listen on `6001`, but you can change the port by specifying the `--port` switch.  
If you faced any problems, you may fire an issue.
